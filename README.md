# Opencv Sketch

### The follwing repository contains code to convert any image using opencv functions

#### There are basically 4 steps:
 1. Convert the RGB color image to grayscale.
 2. Invert the grayscale image to get a negative.
 3. Apply a blur to the negative.
 4. Blend the grayscale image with the blurred negative using a color dodge.
